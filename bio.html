            <article>
              <h4>AOIT</h4>
              <p>
                While in <b>AOIT</b>, I was introduced to the high tech industry through various hands<br> 
                on experience and courses, such as introductory media art. I was amazed by how<br>
                much I could do with just a screen, a keyboard, and a mouse. I immediately fell<br>
                in love with it. In senior year, my love and passion for technologies inspired<br>
                me to enroll in a computer programming class, where I learned basic <code>javascript</code><br>
                coding techniques. Ever since then, I knew that I wanted to pursue a career in<br>
                computer science.

            <h3>My City College</h3>
            <article>
              <h4>Basic programming</h4>
              <p>
                In college, I have exposed myself to a wide range of courses related to computer<br> 
                science and programming, especially in <code>C++</code> and <code>Java</code>. There, I created workpieces<br> 
                such as simple graphics that involve temperature conversion, which disapplies a<br> 
                screen that can convert between celsius to fahrenheit. I further applied the knowledge<br> 
                I obtained from classes by spending my spare time to code a small game with a group of<br> 
                friends who share the same interests and hobbies. It was more difficult than we<br> 
                thought, because there are many components that must go together perfectly for<br> 
                the game to run smoothly and efficiently.

            <h3>My UCSD</h3>
            <article>
              <h4>Know the problem</h4>
              <p>
                When we <em>encounter</em> a challenge, we would discuss with each other to find a<br> 
                solution to the problem.<strong>This allowed me and the group to share ideas that<br> 
                would improve every aspect of the game, as well as our understanding in the<br> 
                secret of coding.</strong> With the extensive in-class experience and the extracurricular<br> 
                activity in which I am involved in, I have made adequate preparation for upper<br> 
                division courses.

            <article>
              <h4>Creatively</h4>
              <p>
                Finding an <strong>alternative solution</strong> allows me to learn what my mistakes could be, as well as<br>
                providing me an opportunity to try out new things. It also encourages me to look at the<br> 
                problem  from another angle so that I know how to solve it more quickly and effectively<br> 
                when it occurs again. A perfect game code cannot be created overnight. It requires many<br> 
                rounds of revision in the process, and this process is what permits my creativity to<br> 
                flourish and be polymorphic.
