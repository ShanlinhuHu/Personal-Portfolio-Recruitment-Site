          <h2>Learning Technologies Consultant(1.5 years)</h2>
              <p>I worked as a <strong>Learning Technologies Consultant</strong>. My main responsibility <br>
                  is to monitor school computer labs and solve any issues that may occur. While on duty,<br> 
                  I often see students browsing the internet for inaccurate online resources because<br> 
                  they cannot find tutoring sessions for their classes or timeslots that work for<br> 
                  their schedules. I understand how it feels to struggle through classes in the middle<br>
                  of the semester, so I took the initiative to offer assistance.
